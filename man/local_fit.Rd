\usage{
local_fit(explainer, observation, selected_variable, grid_points = 101,
  select_points = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{explainer}{a model to be explained, preprocessed by the 'DALEX::explain' function}

\item{observation}{a new observarvation for which predictions need to be explained}

\item{selected_variable}{variable to be presented in the local fit plot}

\item{grid_points}{number of points used for response path}

\item{select_points}{fraction of points fromvalidation data to be presented in local fit plots}
}
\value{
An object of the class 'local_fit_explainer'.
It's a data frame with calculated average responses.
