\title{Local Conditional Expectation Explainer}
\usage{
local_conditional_expectations(explainer, observations, y = NULL,
  variable_splits = NULL, variables = NULL, grid_points = 101)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{true labels for `new_observation`. If specified then will be added to LCE plots.}

\item{variable_splits}{named list of splits for variables, in most cases created with `calculate_variable_splits()`. If NULL then it will be calculated based on validation data avaliable in the `explainer`.}

\item{variables}{names of variables for which profiles shall be calculated. Will be passed to `calculate_variable_splits()`. If NULL then all variables from the validation data will be used.}

\item{grid_points}{number of points for profile. Will be passed to `calculate_variable_splits()`.}

\item{x}{a model to be explained, or an explainer created with function `DALEX::explain()`.}

\item{data}{validation dataset, will be extracted from `x` if it's an explainer}

\item{predict_function}{predict function, will be extracted from `x` if it's an explainer}

\item{new_observation}{a new observation with columns that corresponds to variables used in the model}

\item{...}{other parameters}

\item{label}{name of the model. By default it's extracted from the 'class' attribute of the model}
}
\value{
An object of the class 'ceteris_paribus_explainer'.
A data frame with calculated LCE profiles.
}
\description{
This explainer works for individual observations.
For each observation it calculates Local Conditional Expectation (LCE) profiles for selected variables.
